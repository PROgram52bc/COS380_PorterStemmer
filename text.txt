WASHINGTON — President Trump dismissed on Friday as a “partisan” attack a whistle-blower complaint said to involve his dealings with Ukraine amid mounting questions about his interactions with the country’s new government.

Details of the complaint remained murky, but the revelation that it was connected at least in part to Ukraine immediately increased scrutiny on Mr. Trump’s relationship with the government in Kiev. He has publicly pushed for Ukraine’s leaders to investigate a political rival, Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and questions have emerged about whether it was related to a White House hold on military aid for Ukraine that it recently released.

“It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistle-blower,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he also acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.”

When asked whether he had brought up Mr. Biden during a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump waved away the question but added, “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden.”
